This implements the Outlier exploratory data discovery analysis for detecting when feature Amount (Medication) Dispensed has any outlier risk for potential discrepancy for balance computation. This study can serve as the base foundation framework which can be offered as a starting point for building a data quality feedback loop to integrate together into doctor's data practices. For such a quality feedback loop to work effectly, there must be a full complete analysis which can accurately identify outliers that may skew critical computations.
